**!UPDATE**: 

**[2025.02.10]** methylGPT is now available on PyPI

**[2024.12.10]** We made initial launching of the methylGPT codebase.

**[2024.11.04]** Manuscript available on biorXiv


## Installation

methylGPT works with Python >= 3.9.10  and R >=3.6.1. Please make sure you have the correct version of Python and R installed pre-installation.

methylGPT is available on PyPI. To install methylGPT, run the following command:

```bash
pip install methylgpt "flash-attn<1.0.5"  # optional, recommended
```

[Optional] We recommend using [wandb](https://wandb.ai/) for logging and visualization.

```bash
pip install wandb
```

For developing, we are using the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager. To install Poetry, follow the instructions [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/albert-ying/MethylGPT
$ cd MethylGPT
$ poetry install
```

**Note**: The `flash-attn` dependency usually requires specific GPU and CUDA version. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [flash-attn](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention/tree/main) repository for installation instructions. For now, May 2023, we recommend using CUDA 11.7 and flash-attn<1.0.5 due to various issues reported about installing new versions of flash-attn.


## Running pretraining

The primary pretraining code is implemented in `methylgpt.pretraining.py`. During training, model checkpoints are automatically saved to the `save/` directory at the end of each epoch.

For a detailed walkthrough of the pretraining process, refer to our step-by-step examples in the [pretraining tutorials](tutorials/pretraining).

## # Pretrained methylGPT Models

This repository provides access to our suite of pretraining models for DNA methylation analysis. The major data sources for pretraining are derived from a comprehensive collection of human DNA methylation profiles.

### Major Data Sources for Pretraining

We collected a total of **226,555 human DNA methylation profiles** aggregated from **5,281 datasets** through two complementary resources: EWAS Data Hub and Clockbase.

| Data Sources                         | Datasets (Combined) | DNA Methylation Profiles | Description                                                                                  | Links                                                                                     |

### Pretraining Dataset

MethylGPT leverages one of the largest DNA methylation corpora ever assembled, comprising **226,555 human DNA methylation profiles** meticulously collected from **5,281 datasets** across two complementary resources: EWAS Data Hub and Clockbase. This unprecedented scale enables our foundation model to capture the complex patterns and variations in the human methylome across diverse tissue types, conditions, and developmental stages. Our comprehensive preprocessing pipeline ensures high-quality input data, with pre-processed datasets readily available for download. This extensive pretraining corpus forms the backbone of MethylGPT's remarkable ability to generalize across methylation tasks and generate biologically meaningful predictions, even in low-data settings.

Choose the appropriate model size based on your computational resources and intended use:

- **Tiny:** Ideal for lightweight experiments and quick prototyping.
- **Small:** Suitable for moderate computational resources and intermediate analyses.
- **Medium:** Recommended for comprehensive studies and robust analytical tasks.


### Usage

- **Recommended model:** We suggest using the `methylGPT-normal` model for most applications unless computational constraints require a lighter model.
- **Checkpoint folders:** We don't provide checkpoints yet. #Each model checkpoint is provided along with a paired vocabulary file mapping gene names to IDs.
